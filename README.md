# School-Mess-Payment-System
an offline, all platfrom payment system for small scale application at the Students'mess at the Technical University of Kenya.
Getting in line, paying then placing your order for food at the school mess' is ironically a mess; might take more than thirtry minutes before you get served something that ough to take no more than ten minutes.
The main cause is that all mpesa transactions need to be recorded first before an order can be placed with the cooking team, then subsequent delays due to too many orders piling up yet the person serving has no record of the orders and has to keep going back to the cashier to confirm which order belongs to who.
Thus, the School Mess Paymeny System is a necessary solution if not the only one to the problems facing our school mess.
The SMPS allows a user to place and pay for their order form the comfort of their phones, which allows the mess team to receive orders, store them, and have mpesa messages recorded correctly with ease. The cashier only needs to update the kitchen team with orders as soon as they are received on their end. 
Once a customer arrives on site, they only need show their order number to the service lady.
